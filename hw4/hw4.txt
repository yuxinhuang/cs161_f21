Graph1 with 3 colors is unsatisfiable.
Graph1 with 4 colors is satisfiable.

The answers of these two SAT instances tell us that we should have at least 4 colors to satifiy this SAT coloring problem, which is the maximum degree of the graph.

One possible solution:
Color set: {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow}
Node set: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
Solution:
1 : Red
2 : Blue
3 : Green
4 : Blue
5 : Yellow
6 : Green
7 : Yellow


The minimum number of colors required to properly color Graph2 is 8.
